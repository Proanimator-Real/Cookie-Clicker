# Useless Items

This folder documents the intentionally redundant JavaScript files used by the project.

The following files are considered "useless" (they all contain the same game logic duplicated across files):

- game1.js
- game2.js
- game3.js
- game4.js
- game5.js
- game6.js
- game7.js
- game8.js
- game9.js
- game10.js

Notes
- All ten files implement the same Cookie Clicker logic and differ only by a unique storage key. They were created as separate files on purpose.
- If you want to remove the redundancy, refactoring into a single shared script (e.g., `game.js`) with a small theme loader is recommended.
